Here's some basic instructions on compiling FCEUGX. You don't need to be a programmer to follow these instructions but you should have some basic computer know-how. There's a few reasons you might want to do this:

 # To use the latest version of the emulator (note that beta versions may be unstable)
 # To access roms/saves from Windows File Sharing (SMB), without needing an SD card - just edit fceuconfig.cpp
 # To make your own custom changes

= Instructions =

 # Ensure that you have [http://www.devkitpro.org devkitPPC r23 and libogc 1.8.7] or higher installed. If you have an older version, completely uninstall it first.
 # Download and copy the [http://sourceforge.net/projects/devkitpro/files/portlibs ported libraries] to your PPC portlibs folder (on Windows this is c:\devkitPro\portlibs\ppc)
 # Download the source from [http://code.google.com/p/fceugc/source/checkout SVN].
 # Run Programmer's Notepad (installed with devkitPro)
 # Find the Makefile from the source you downloaded. Click Tools > Make.
 # You're done!
